# Bus Reservation System Using Django Framwork and SQLite
Implementation of a Bus Reservation System (BRS) using Django, a high-level Python web framework. The BRS aims to streamline the process of bus ticket booking, reservation management, and seat allocation. The system provides users with a convenient platform to search for bus routes, select seats, make reservations, and manage bookings. Additionally, it offers administrators tools for managing bus schedules, routes, and user data. The implementation follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture.
